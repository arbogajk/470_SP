## Introduction ##

This is an implementation of [Shamir's Secret Sharing][shamir], taken from
github user [fletcher](https://github.com/fletcher/c-sss)

We are working on the parallelization and distributed computation of Fletcher's implementation of Shamir's 
Secret Sharing Algorithm as part of a course project in CS 470: Parallel and Distributed Systems
at [James Madison University](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs470_2017_01/). We have successfully
implemented parallel encryption using OpenMP, without breaking the decryption. We are 
seeing linear speed up times with encryption currently as well as decryption.

Compiled with -fopenmp and also is setup to use MPI, but is not currently implemented anywhere
in the code.  Because the makefiles use MPICC, **the module must be loaded**. 


Makefiles are included for both parallel and serial versions in their respective directories.
We created a make shell script located in the `src` directory to handle running make in each directory 
so it's best to just use that.

The majority of our work has taken place in `src/par/par_shamir.c` and `src/par/main.c`

## Usage:  ##

Compile with make.sh script file.

There is a tester script located in the src directory for testing scaling

To use tester script:

        ./test_script.sh <n> <t> <file>

##### Example Usage: #####

	./test_script.sh 255 150 1080CC.txt

**OR**

Running individual test from src directory:

#### Example: ####

        OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 srun par/par_shamir 255 255 < 1080CC.txt


This will encrypt the text file string and generate 255 shares, all 255 of which are required
to unlock the secret.  The key shares generated are written to `keys.txt`.

**DO NOT GO OVER 255 FOR EITHER SHARES OR REQUIRED UNLOCK(causes seg faults)**

There are included test files with varying character lengths specified by the number in the
text file name.  Use these as inputs into the program to test scaling.

### Decryption ###
To decrypt input the keys.txt file into the program and it will generate the
decrypted text file. The keys.txt file is generated by the program after encryption.
The tester script will automatically handle inputing this file into the program.

### Decryption Individual Test: ####

#### Example: ####

	OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 srun par/par_shamir < keys.txt
**To output the decrypted file:**
	OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 srun par/par_shamir < keys.txt > decrypted_file.txt

This reads the keys from `keys.txt` and uses them to decrypt the secret,
which is then output on stdout.  The tester script also outputs the decrypted
text file to a file called `decrypted_file.txt` for checking, but also prints
to stdout while the program is running.

## Project Status ##

We have successfully parallelized the the `split_number` function using OpenMP directives.  Specifically
we parallelized the random coefficient generation and have parallelized the for loop that calculates
the shares.  We just recently were able to parallelize the decryption and see linear scaling with it as well.  
The challenge was figuring out which variables needed to be private.  
To summarize which functions have been parallelize with OpenMp: `split_number` (part of encrypting files), and `join_shares`(decryption).,

### TODOs ###

* Experiment with scheduling and do a performance writeup on it
* Integrate MPI in place of OpenMP directives or incorporate it into the 
  existing OpenMP directives.
* Make decryption performance charts and include them in the repository.

## The Shares ##
**From Fletcher's github page:**

Each share looks like this:

	0102AA05C0DF2BD6

The first two characters indicate the number of the share (in hex). The
next two characters indicate how many shares are required to decrypt the
secret (again in hex).  The next two characters (`AA`), are fake and enable
the shares to also be used on a website:

<http://www.christophedavid.org/w/c/w.php/Calculators/ShamirSecretSharing>

I cannot vouch for the security of this website -- it claims not to send
any of your information over the internet, but that may or may not be true.


## Security Issues ##
**Fletcher:**

I am not a cryptologist.  From what I can gather from the internet, Shamir's
algorithm is secure -- without a sufficient number of shares, you cannot
"crack the code."  I *believe* that I have implemented the algorithm correctly,
based on what I can read and the fact that it generates compatible results
with another implementation.

Because the secret is encrypted one character at a time, you can use the 
length of the shares to determine the length of the secret.  Depending on
your needs, you could pad the secret with spaces to obscure the actual
length.

Naturally, you have to protect the shares as you would the password, especially
when you have all of them together.

I do not do anything special with the code to guard against any attacks on 
your machine, such as trying to read memory that was used by the application.
If someone has (reasonable) suggestions, I am happy to implement them.  But 
my intent was not to create something that will guard against motivated
attackers with significant resources.

To the best of my knowledge, this program is reasonably safe to use.  You can
readily view the source to ensure that your information is not being sent over
the internet or saved to other files.  But ultimately, it's your responsibility
to use the software carefully.

If you discover any problems with the program, please let me know!
