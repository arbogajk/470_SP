## Introduction ##

This is an implementation of [Shamir's Secret Sharing][shamir], originally written by
github user [fletcher](https://github.com/fletcher/c-sss) @fletcher, parallelized by
Joey Arbogast and Isaac Sumner.

We were able to parallelize the computation of Fletcher's implementation of Shamir's 
Secret Sharing Algorithm as part of a course project in CS 470: Parallel and Distributed Systems
at [James Madison University](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs470_2017_01/). We have successfully
implemented parallel versions of the `split_string` and `split_number` function using OpenMP.  We were also
able to parallelize the `join_shares` function that handles reconstructing the secret. We are 
seeing near linear speed up times with key generation and joining the shares.

## How to Compile ##
### Prerequistes ###
* OpenMP must be installed on the system
* SLURM must be installed for the `test_script.sh` script to work.

**Compiled with -fopenmp**   

Makefiles are included for both parallel and and the original serial versions in their respective directories.
We created a make shell script located in the `src` directory to handle running make in each directory 
so it's best to just use that.
	./make.sh


The majority of our work has taken place in `src/par/par_shamir.c` and `src/par/main.c`

## Usage:  ##
### Test Data Sets ###
The text files and private RSA key we used in our scaling test are located in the directory
`src/test_input_files` and should be used in the scaling test.

### Running the Tester Shell Script ###
There is a tester script located in the src directory for testing scaling called `test_script.sh`.
The script takes 3 arguments, the number of shares to generate, the required threshold for unlocking 
the secret and the input file to conduct the test with.

The script handles strong scaling test, doubling the thread count each pass up to 16 threads.  It also
handles strong scaling test of joining the shares back up to reproduce the secret up to 16 threads and
outputs the secret to make sure it worked.

The command line option -d may be specified to print the keys to stdout.

The weak scaling test at the end of the shell script starts with our 540 character text file, and doubles
the thread count and input data size (number of characters in the file) each time up to 16 threads.


To use tester script:

        ./test_script.sh <n> <t> <file>

##### Example Usage: #####

	./test_script.sh 255 150 test_input_files/1080CC.txt

**OR**

Running individual test from src directory:

#### Example: ####

        OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 srun par/par_shamir 255 255 < test_input_files/1080CC.txt


This will generate 255 key shares from the text file all 255 of which are required
to unlock the secret.  The key shares generated are written to `keys.txt`. If you delete keys from the file to
make it less than the unlock threshold you can verify that the original secret cannot be reconstructed.

**DO NOT GO OVER 255 FOR EITHER SHARES OR REQUIRED UNLOCK(causes seg faults)**


### Joining Shares to Reproduce Secret  ###
To join the key shares and produce the original secret input the keys.txt file into the program and it will generate the
original secret. The keys.txt file is generated by the program after the shares generation.
The tester script will automatically handle inputing this file into the program.

### Joining Shares with Individual Test: ####

#### Example: ####

	OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 srun par/par_shamir < keys.txt

**To output the decrypted file:**

	OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 srun par/par_shamir < keys.txt > decrypted_file.txt

This reads the keys from `keys.txt` and uses them to reproduce the secret,
which is then output on stdout.  The tester script also outputs the secret into a
text file called `decrypted_file.txt` for checking, but also prints
to stdout while the program is running.

## Project Status ##

We have successfully parallelized the the `split_number`, `split_string` and `join_shares` functions using OpenMP directives.
We were unsuccessful in implementing distributed computation as well using MPICH.  We still believe it is possible, but were 
unable to implement it in the project time.



#### Update as of 4/23/2017 ####
* We were able to get better weak scaling results by parallelizing an inner forloop in `split_string`.
* We have been unsucessful thus far with implementing MPI.  We have been focused on using MPI_Gather in
the 'split_number' function, but any calls to MPI collective operations seem to cause deadlock.  We
have tried to proctect the call with omp master, omp single, omp critical, but that doesn't seem to
help.

### TODOs ###


* Integrate MPI in place of OpenMP directives or incorporate it into the 
  existing OpenMP directives.

## The Shares ##
** Shares Explantion From Fletcher's github page:**

Each share looks like this:

	0102AA05C0DF2BD6

The first two characters indicate the number of the share (in hex). The
next two characters indicate how many shares are required to decrypt the
secret (again in hex).  The next two characters (`AA`), are fake and enable
the shares to also be used on a website:

<http://www.christophedavid.org/w/c/w.php/Calculators/ShamirSecretSharing>

I cannot vouch for the security of this website -- it claims not to send
any of your information over the internet, but that may or may not be true.


## Security Issues ##
**Fletcher:**

I am not a cryptologist.  From what I can gather from the internet, Shamir's
algorithm is secure -- without a sufficient number of shares, you cannot
"crack the code."  I *believe* that I have implemented the algorithm correctly,
based on what I can read and the fact that it generates compatible results
with another implementation.

Because the secret is encrypted one character at a time, you can use the 
length of the shares to determine the length of the secret.  Depending on
your needs, you could pad the secret with spaces to obscure the actual
length.

Naturally, you have to protect the shares as you would the password, especially
when you have all of them together.

I do not do anything special with the code to guard against any attacks on 
your machine, such as trying to read memory that was used by the application.
If someone has (reasonable) suggestions, I am happy to implement them.  But 
my intent was not to create something that will guard against motivated
attackers with significant resources.

To the best of my knowledge, this program is reasonably safe to use.  You can
readily view the source to ensure that your information is not being sent over
the internet or saved to other files.  But ultimately, it's your responsibility
to use the software carefully.

If you discover any problems with the program, please let me know!
